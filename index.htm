    <!-- span is an in line tag that is used to paint over whatever we want
    apart from the CSS that is applied in the doc.
say suppose for some thing in a particular document you want some word to be forma
tted differently then you can do so to that particular word without chan
ging the rest of the CSS at all.

div basically does the same thing but is for multiple lines. span is for 
inline stuff!-->
<!-- div tag is a block tag -->
<!-- div tag has no default styling but p tag has spaces all around it by default! -->
